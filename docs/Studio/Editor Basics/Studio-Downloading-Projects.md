# Studio Downloading Projects

> Note that this functionality is only available in the **web version** of Studio.

If you ever need to save the contents of your project without pushing to a Git repository, you can download a zip file of the current project directly from the Studio settings menu.

2. Navigate to the settings menu using the cog wheel at the left bottom corner of the screen
3. Select the **Project Settings** option from the menu
4. Click the **Download Project** button, which will start the download

> This functionality was added with v1.1.0 of Stoplight Studio.
